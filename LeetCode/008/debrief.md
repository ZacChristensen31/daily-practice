This one seemed really easy for what it was. Given a tree and a clone of the tree, we wanted to return the
node of the cloned tree that was the target. Essentially we just traversed the tree until we found the 
node with the same value which wasn't even an algorithm. I'm not sure if this was just because we did it in
Python?
